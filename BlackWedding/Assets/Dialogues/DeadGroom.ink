You sat alone in the dimly lit room, surrounded by the flickering candles and the scent of incense. #Italic
*[Contiinue]
As the air grew thick with an otherworldly presence, the ghostly form of your beloved fiancÃ© appeared before you. #Italic
**[Contiinue]
His eyes were full of a sadness that you had never seen before. #Italic
My love, what are you doing here? 
***[I am here to have a black wedding ceremony that will bind us together forevermore.]
-> BecauseOfLove
***[I do but follow tradition] 
-> BecauseOfTradition



==BecauseOfLove==
-The groom's lips curved into a smile as he gazed at his beloved, and he spoke with a hint of humor in his voice. #Italic
*[Continue]
Why must it be a black wedding, my dear?
he asked, his eyes twinkling. #Italic
Is there not enough darkness in the world already?
**[Continue]
Your lips parted in a spontaneous smile #Italic
***[You know, I have to undergo the ceremony] -> BecauseOfTradition
***[I just miss you so much]
 You must let me go,
****[Continue]
You cannot be tied to me like this
 his voice heavy with sorrow. #Italic
 *****[You know, I have to undergo the ceremony] -> BecauseOfTradition
 *****[I don't know if I can let you go] 
 You must find a way to move on without me.
 ******[But what about our families, our traditions?]
This is your life, and you have the power to choose what you want.
 *******[stop Black Wedding] -> HowToEscape
 *******[go through the ceremony] -> BecauseOfTradition
 
 ==BecauseOfTradition==
 The groom looked at you with a mixture of confusion and concern #Italic
*[For the sake of our families and the sanctity of the church, it is imperative that we proceed in the manner that has been ordained by our forebears.]
I understand now
he said, his voice echoing with a melancholy that belied his smile #Italic
If that is what you truly desire, then I will be here for you.
**[Thank you] -> Reveal
**[I know I can always count on you, even in death.] -> Reveal


==Reveal==
But before the Black Wedding, I implore you to discover the truth about the church.
*[What truth?]
The answer to your question lies hidden within the iconostasis
**[Continue]
But beware, the iconostasis is a sacred place, inaccessible to all but the holiest of ministers. You must tread carefully.
***[I understand]
Once you find what you seek, show it to the artist. I believe it will convince her to speak out against the church and reveal their darkest secrets.
