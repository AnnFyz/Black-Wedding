The priest's eyes flicker with a fervent gleam as I approach him, his voice low and reverent. #Italic

Blessed be your arrival, Radmila, into the holy sanctuary of our congregation. I understand that this is a difficult time for you. We all empathize with your suffering.

*** [Continue]
It is a challenging path, but one that brings purpose and meaning, and unites us as a community, closer to God.

*** [1. Thank you, Father, for your kind words. Everything feels so...strange, these days. One day he is here, and the next...  I apologize, Father, I'm feeling overwhelmed by it all.]

Do not weep for Avram, for he has ascended to a higher plane of existence. He is now in God's realm, watching over us and guiding us towards the path of righteousness.

**** [Continue]
 Despite the tragedy, it is a great honor to participate in this ancient rite, for it means that you have chosen to join Avram in his eternal service to God.

**** [Continue]
Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed, you will be forever honored and revered by our commune. And Avram's soul will wait for you in Heaven, forever bound to you.

***** [1. Father, what of my soul? What if I am unable to bear this burden? This was not how it was supposed to be.] 

    ------- You must understand that this is not just about Avram or yourself, but about the spiritual wellbeing of our entire commune.
   ****** [Continue]
    ------ It is your destiny, your fate, your... obligation.

    ------ His jaw clenches for a moment before he regains his composure, his expression morphing into a contemptuous sneer beneath his grizzled beard, his eyes fixed on the vibrant frescoes above. #Italic
   ****** [Continue]
   ------ Do not doubt the will of God. He has a plan for you. A plan for all of us, and it is our duty to follow it, no matter the cost.If you would...refuse to save Avram's soul, you would not only turn your back to him, to this community. You would be turning your back on God himself.
   ****** [Continue]
    ------ And those who reject the will of God, who turn away from the path of righteousness, they are not welcome in our commune. They may only be are exiled, left to fend for themselves in the Great Beyond. I'm sure you understand what that means.
    ****** [1. I understand, Father. I would still like to be privy to the details of this ritual.]  -> Ritual_Description

***** [2. Be that as it may, I'm still unsure how the ritual is going to proceed. I feel so lost in all of this.] -> Ritual_Description

== Ritual_Description ==

    Listen, my child, for I will guide you through the sacred ritual of the Black Wedding. You shall spend this night in the sanctuary, where you shall tend to the Celestial Candle, ensuring its luminance does not falter until the break of dawn.
    * [Continue]
    As the new day arises, we shall await the guests and then lead the procession to the burial ground, where the groom's banner shall be torn, and his mortal shell committed to the earth. Then, the true wedding ceremony will begin, over his sacred tomb.
    ** [Continue]
    As you vow your allegiance to Avram, you shall leave your flower wreath upon his tombstone, a symbol of your eternal bond. The celebration shall follow, as decreed by God, with dancing, singing, and feasting, as we honor Avram's soul, and ensure his ascension to Heaven.
    *** [Continue]
    The binding of your souls will be complete, my child, and you shall be forever cherished as his bride in this eternal union.

* [1. I want to know more about the Celestial Candle.] -> Candle
* [2. What kind of banner will we be carrying to his grave?] -> Banner
* {(Candle || Banner)} -> Ending 

==Candle==
The priest's demeanor shifts into solemnity as his gaze drifts towards the alcove, where a lavish candelabra stands in solitude. #Italic
* [Continue]
The Celestial Candle is a holy artifact, an instrument of the God's will. It is covered in ornate wax flowers, adorned with mirrors, and holds 44 candles atop, symbolizing the 44 saints who serve as His divine servants.
** [Continue]
This very candle was crafted by the late groom's mother, as the tradition demands. 
*** [Continue]
It is your solemn duty to light and tend to the flame of this sacred candle throughout the night, for it is said that the groom's soul travels to the site of the candle when it is first lit. 
**** [Continue]
In the case of an unforseeable, tragic death such as this, known as "muarÄ‡a fara rind," the deceased soul must have a candle to guide them on their path to God's side. Without it, they risk wandering in the darkness, lost in the warp, or worse, wandering into Hell itself.
***** [Continue]
This is why the Celestial Candle is of such great importance, for it illuminates the path to Heaven and ensures the safe passage of the groom's soul. -> Candle_Banner


==Banner==
The banner serves as a commemoration of the deceased person's life, an homage to their deeds and piousness. The imagery depicted is collage of selected moments from the deceased's life.
* [Continue]
It is painted by a 'suto kala', our fresco painter who possesses a unique artistic talent granted by the divine. However, I would advise against engaging her in conversation.
** [Continue]
She tends to become deeply absorbed in her work and may not always speak sensibly. Pay her no heed.
*** [Continue]
The priest's tone sounds slightly reserved as he speaks of the painter. He notices my gaze, then smiles back at me. His eyes, however, remain stern. I get the sense that he may be withholding information. -> Candle_Banner

== Ending==
In any case, my child, it is my duty as a servant of the Divine to attend to the sacred tasks before me. 
* [Continue]
I suggest you attend to your own preparations, for there is much work to be done before dawn breaks. I urge you to seek out the groom's mother, who has just arrived and can be found within the sanctuary. 
** [Continue]
She will be able to assist you with any concerns you may have. May the grace of God be with you.

*** [1.Thank you for your guidance, Father. I will speak to the groom's mother and make sure everything is in order.]
