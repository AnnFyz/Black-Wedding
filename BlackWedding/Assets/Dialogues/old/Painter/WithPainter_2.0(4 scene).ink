"I beg your pardon, but alas, I cannot engage in conversation with you,
replied the painter with a tinge of regret. # Italic
* [Leave]
    -> END
    
*[What if I tell you that the priest's prohibitions should no longer affect you?]
The painter listened intently, a look of curiosity on her face. # Italic
What do you mean?
**[I mean that we should no longer be bound by the old ways and beliefs that have limited us for so long]
The painter raised an eyebrow, intrigued. # Italic
I found blueprints for cyberware and cyberprosthetics that can improve and empower the body,they were made for the priest himself and are secretly worn by those in the highest echelons of the church.
The painter was taken aback by this revelation.  # Italic
***[I need your help to verify the blueprints,] 
You continued. # Italic
****[Only you have the necessary knowledge to do so. If we can prove that these technologies exist and that the church is keeping them hidden, we can use them to empower ourselves and free ourselves from their control]
The painter hesitated, unsure of the risks involved.  # Italic
*****[We must take that risk]
After a moment of consideration, the painter nodded
Alright, Let's do it.
******[You nodded]
