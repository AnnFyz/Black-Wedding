Ah, my dear. It is good to see you have returned.
And I see that you have completed the ritual. Well done

 * [Thank you, Father.]
 * [I'm glad I could be of help.]
 
 Now is the moment, when you shall finally light the holy candle

 ** [I need some time to prepare myself]
 ** [It shall be done.]

    -> END
